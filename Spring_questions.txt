Part A
1. a. Core technologies
   b. Testing
   c. Data Access
   d. Transactions
   e. JDBC

2.Spring is an open-source application framework that provides infrastructure support for developing Java applications

3. a.Flexibility
   b.Portability
   c.Consistent configuration
   d.Fast delivery
   e.Secure

5. About 20 modules
   core
   beans
   context 
   expression language
   AOP
  JDBC

6. Spring configuration file is an XML file that contains the classes information

7. Spring Boot Starters
   Spring Boot AutoConfigurator
   Spring Boot CLI
   Spring Boot Actuator

9. Spring IoC Container  creates the objects, configures and assembles their dependencies, manages their entire life cycle

10. Spring Dependency injection is a way to inject the dependency of a framework component

11. Press Ctrl+Alt+S to open the IDE settings and select Plugins
    Find the plugin in the Marketplace and click Install

12. java -jar executable. jar â€“server. port=9090

13. By excluding the ErrorMvcAutoConfiguration

15. BeanFactory loads beans on-demand, while ApplicationContext loads all beans at startup
    The ApplicationContext automatically registers BeanFactoryPostProcessor and BeanPostProcessor at startup

16. Inject and Autowired both annotations are used for autowiring in application.


Part B

1. All of the above
2. All of the above
3. Hibernate contextual sessions
4. True
5. Transactional
6. DelegatngFilterProxy
7. Dispatcher Servlet
8. This scopes the bean defining to a single instance per Spring IoC container
9. Association validation
10.Any class that is managed by the container
11.ApplicationContext
12.All of the above
13.Autowiring by property name. Spring tries to match and wire its properties with the beans defined by the
same names in the configuration files
14.The Spring web MVC framework provides model-view-controller architecture and ready components that can be
used to develop flexible and loosely coupled web application
15.All of the above
16.Spring using dependency injection and supports loose coupling
